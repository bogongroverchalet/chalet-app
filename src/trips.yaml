      Snow play, tobogganing, snowboards and ski tow. The sloped area around
      the chalet and down into the valley is great for beginners that need a
      confidence boost.

    description: The first hut constructed for tourists, and location of the first winter parties.
    long-description: >-
      This hut was first constructed in 1929 by the Ski Club of Victoria as a tourist hut following
      a surge in skiing in the 1920s. This was the location of the first winter parties. The hut was
      called "The Menzies of the High Plains" by early skiers and walkers because of its size and
      comfort. Spectacular views down into the valley and the surrounding highplains. On a clear day,
      you can see as far as Benambra on the other side of the Great Dividing Range.

    long-description: >-
      The area is filled with columnar basalt rubble, particularly on the southern side of the hill.
      Basalt mounds have been formed through disintegration of basalt columns through many freeze-thaw
      cycles or frost wedging. Some interesting geological features indicate this may have been a
      site with volcanic activity many thousands or milions of years ago.

      Not everyone expects a waterfall on the highplains, but this is a fun little tucked away one. Good intermediate trip, although on the longer side. Detour via Ryders Yards, and the option of returning via the aqueduct and the southern side of Mt Cope.

      Great place for lunch ðŸ¥ª
