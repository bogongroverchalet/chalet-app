    description: The first hut constructed for tourists, and location of the first winter parties.
    long-description: |
      This hut was first constructed in 1929 by the Ski Club of Victoria as a tourist hut following
      a surge in skiing in the 1920s. This was the location of the first winter parties. The hut was
      called "The Menzies of the High Plains" by early skiers and walkers because of its size and
      comfort. Spectacular views down into the valley and the surrounding highplains. On a clear day,
      you can see as far as Benambra on the other side of the Great Dividing Range.

      First constructed back in 1889, and remains the oldest surviving hut in the Victorian Alps.

      A nearby slope (north east, behind the hut to the right) is somewhat sheltered and another option for ski school. It's easy to access but not as beginner friendly as the Cope Hut ski school slope.

    hazards:
      - The dam wall can be very exposed and not nice. Consider going below the wall on the north side in poor weather - note, though, that this is a more technical bit of skiing due to the ascent and descent.
      - Do not go via the carpark entry at Langfords Gap - use the road/car bridge and leave/join the aqueduct track south of the crossing.
      - Don't fall in the aqueduct.
      - The weather on the dam wall and the far side can be harsh. It's better to get organised coming out of the Nordic Bowl and make a plan (or organise layers, drinks, and snack). The area immediately following the wall is often exposed to the weather and not nice. A few hundred meters further along is nicer and less exposed.

      - Don't fall in the creek.
      - Watch your footing whilst viewing the waterfall itself.
    turnback-points:
      weather:
        - Cope Hut carpark.
        - Cope West Aqueduct road in southerly weather.
      time:

        - Ryder's Huts if not making it before 11 30am.
        - Cope West Aqueduct road before descent to the waterfall before 12pm.
        - Depart the waterfalls by 1pm to 1 30pm.

      Not everyone expects a waterfall on the highplains, but this is a fun little tucked away one. Good intermediate trip, although on the longer side.
